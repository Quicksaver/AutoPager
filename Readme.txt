A port of AutoPager 0.8.0.8 by Wind Li (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/autopager/), with compatibility fixes by me for firefox 26 and above.

Some day I might actually port this into my add-on backbone... Hmm...

For now, you can download the custom installer at https://github.com/Quicksaver/AutoPager/releases/tag/0.8.0.8.1 and drag and drop into your browser to install.
